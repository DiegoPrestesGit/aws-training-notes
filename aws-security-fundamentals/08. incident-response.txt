Incident Response

There are obvious differences between environments built to run in the cloud and environments running on-premises. When it comes to incident response, the same can be said. Incident response in the AWS Cloud is faster, cheaper, more effective, and simpler to manage. Your ability to detect, react, and recover can be significantly enhanced with AWS. Let's take a look at some capabilities for investigation that are only possible by using AWS. 

The Power of APIs for Automation
In AWS, you can use APIs to automate many of the routine tasks that need to be performed during incident response. For example, using a single command, you can isolate an instance by changing the security groups associated with the instance. 

Performing Forensics on Data Volumes
Forensics often requires capturing the disk image or "as-is" configuration of an operating system. You can use Amazon EBS snapshots and the Amazon EC2 APIs to capture the data and state of systems under investigation.

Operating in a Clean Room
AWS CloudFormation can be used to quickly create a new, trusted environment in which to conduct deeper investigation. AWS CloudFormation can deploy preconfigured instances in an isolated environment that contains all the necessary tools forensic teams need to determine the cause of the incident.

AWS Step Functions
AWS Step Functions lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows so you can build and update apps quickly. Workflows are made up of a series of steps, with the output of one step acting as the input into the next. Step Functions can be used to design and run workflows that stitch together services such as AWS Lambda and AWS CloudFormation to respond to an incident in the cloud.

Here we have an example of how to respond to a compromised instance using AWS Step Functions, AWS Lambda, AWS CloudFormation, and Amazon SNS. We start with a script, or third-party tool, pushing instance IDs to an SNS topic. IDs are then verified by a Lambda function, and if compromised, a Step Function workflow is initiated. 

1: The instance is removed from its auto scaling group, a snapshot is created of any attached EBS volume, instance metadata (like IP, AMI ID, subnets. etc.) is recorded, a quarantine resource tag is applied to the instance, and the team is notified.

2: The instance is isolated by removing all its previously associated security groups. Then, a new forensics security group is assigned to the instance with no ingress or egress permissions.

3: An AWS CloudFormation template is used to create a brand new environment, including a new VPC containing a forensics instance with prebuilt tools attached to a copy of any volumes from the snapshots.

4: A basic forensics investigation is performed on the attached volumes.

5: Reports are then generated with the results from the investigation and sent to the team via an SNS topic.
