Protection at Rest

Protecting data at rest has to do with encrypting data while using one of our storage services, including our database services. When it comes to Amazon S3, for example, there are two types of encryption options available.

Protection in Transit

Any data that gets transmitted from one system to another is considered data in transit. AWS recommends the following solutions and best practices to help you provide the appropriate level of protection for your data in transit, including the confidentiality and integrity of your applicationâ€™s data.

=> AWS services provide HTTPS endpoints using TLS for communication, thus providing end-to-end encryption when communicating with the AWS APIs.

=> Use AWS to generate, deploy, and manage public and private certificates used for TLS encryption in web-based workloads.

=> Use IPsec with VPN connectivity into AWS to facilitate encryption of traffic.
