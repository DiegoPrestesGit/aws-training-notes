Capturing and Collecting Logs

Detective controls are an essential part of governance frameworks and can be used to identify a potential security threat or incident. In AWS, there are a number of approaches to consider when addressing detective controls. AWS CloudTrail records API calls made on your account. This information helps you track changes made to your AWS resources, troubleshoot operational issues, and ensure compliance with internal policies and regulatory standards.
